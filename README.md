# Introduction

Galacticraft Clock is an addon for Galacticraft that allows you to view the
time on other celestial bodies. It was created in response to the changes to
the time sync behavior that were made due to
[#2643](https://github.com/micdoodle8/Galacticraft/issues/2643).

## How to Use

Simply place a Display Screen and a Satellite Dish within 700 blocks of the
screen, and turn the screen to the new Clock channel. The screen will cycle
through each celestial body and show you its progress through its own day/
night cycle for a few seconds.
